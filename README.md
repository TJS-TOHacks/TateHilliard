Our team understands how stressful life currently is, and we wanted to help out by providing easily accessible and 
personalized information to anyone. We developed a digital survey for COVID-19 that would provide useful information to 
people unique to their situation and provide guidelines for people in any circumstance. If the general public is more informed 
about their personal situation against COVID-19 there will be less uncertainty and in turn less stress. Before starting this 
hack we had very little idea how to take inputs from an HTML webpage. After some trial and error we found that JavaScript 
would solve our problems and we got moving. We built our webpage with HTML and CSS and provided functionality and interaction 
using JavaScript. We collaborated remotely through Visual Studio Live Share. Overall this project may not be super complex 
but we learned a ton (none of even knew JavaScript before 12:00 pm on Saturday) and can't wait to compete again if we are 
given the opportunity. We are proud of our website because we believe it is an effective way to provide specific guidance 
to the general public, and we believe with further development it could greatly alleviate uncertainty and mental health 
issues surrounding COVID-19. Creating this webpage provided us with a low risk medium to learn something new, and we had 
fun doing it!
